heya


after many compling and compling and compling this project is finally finished


i removed the cutscenes because on stress they would make the game crash

i added pico speaker (it lags a lil when he first starts shooting)

tank rolling

better stage placement

fixed the smoke boping to the beat

HUGE SHOUTOUT TO

CuteySans(Sanscode1937)ðŸ†–#1451

A EpicModDeveloper#1853

and Meow Charles#9050

without them this project  wouldn't be where it is today.

i STRONGLY reccomend you play the newgrounds version to support ninjamuffin and the team: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371

DO NOT treat this as official, it was simply a fan made project because i was bored

DO NOT ASK ME TO CHANGE/ADD ANYTHING: like i said this a fun project and i won't be stressing over the little things like cutscenes or other stuff. this project is open source so you can add shit yourself.

thanks for trying this out, makes me happy <3
